### Blue Team | SOC & CSIRT | Cybersecurity Operations

Cybersecurity-focused Computer Science student with a clear focus on **Blue Team operations**, **SOC monitoring**, and **CSIRT activities**.  
My background includes offensive security fundamentals, which I use to better understand attacker behavior and improve defensive detection and response.

I am particularly interested in **incident response, security monitoring, and operational cybersecurity**, working with structured processes and real-world scenarios.
